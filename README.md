# ProducerConsumer_Threading
This is a solution to a multi-process synchronization problem by using Mutex and Semaphores.

Steps to running the program.

1. javac ProducerConsumer.java
2. java ProducerConsumer 20 10 5 
      a. The first integer specifies how the program will run for in the code that int is multiplied
          by a 1000 which makes it 20secs.
      b. The second integer specifies the number of producer threads to produce
      c. The last integer specifies the number of consumer threads to produce
      
you can insert your own values, they do not always have to be 20 10 5. That was just an example.
